**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Status:** READY FOR TESTING
**Option Implemented:** Option B - Enhanced Custom AlignmentGuides
**Architecture:** Moveable.js + Selecto + Custom SVG Guides

---

## What Was Implemented

### Enhanced AlignmentGuides Component

**File:** `/src/components/dashboard-builder/AlignmentGuides.tsx`

**Key Enhancements:**

1. **Multi-Select Support**
   - Changed from single `activeComponent` to `activeComponents: CanvasComponent[]`
   - Shows alignment guides for ALL selected components simultaneously
   - Each component checked against all others for alignments

2. **Relevance Scoring**
   - Added `calculateRelevance()` function
   - Dimension matches (width/height): Score 100 (highest priority)
   - Edge alignment (left/right/top/bottom): Score 80
   - Center alignment (horizontal/vertical): Score 60
   - Sorting ensures most important guides shown first

3. **Smart Guide Limiting**
   - Reduced from 5 to 10 maximum guides per render
   - Prevents visual clutter with many components
   - Guides sorted by relevance before limiting

4. **Memoization**
   - Uses `useMemo` to prevent recalculation on every render
   - Dependencies: `[activeComponents, allComponents, tolerance]`
   - Performance optimized for large component counts

5. **Visual Design**
   - **Purple solid lines (#A855F7):** Edge and center alignment
   - **Pink dashed lines (#EC4899):** Dimension matching
   - **Dimension labels:** Displayed in colored boxes (width/height values)
   - **Professional appearance:** Looker Studio / Figma style

### Updated DashboardCanvas Component

**File:** `/src/components/dashboard-builder/DashboardCanvas.tsx`

**Key Changes:**

1. **State Management**
   ```typescript
   // Before
   const [activeCanvasComponent, setActiveCanvasComponent] = useState<CanvasComponentType | null>(null);

   // After
   const [activeCanvasComponents, setActiveCanvasComponents] = useState<CanvasComponentType[]>([]);
   ```

2. **Single Drag Handler Enhanced**
   ```typescript
   const handleDrag = useCallback(({ target, left, top }) => {
     // Now gets all selected components, not just the one being dragged
     const activeComps = canvasComponents.filter(c => selectedComponentIds.has(c.id));
     const updated = activeComps.map(comp =>
       comp.id === id ? { ...comp, x: left, y: top } : comp
     );
     setActiveCanvasComponents(updated);
   }, [canvasComponents, selectedComponentIds]);
   ```

3. **Group Drag Handler Enhanced**
   ```typescript
   const handleDragGroup = useCallback(({ events }) => {
     const activeComps: CanvasComponentType[] = [];
     events.forEach((ev) => {
       const comp = canvasComponents.find(c => c.id === id);
       if (comp) {
         activeComps.push({ ...comp, x: ev.left, y: ev.top });
       }
     });
     setActiveCanvasComponents(activeComps);
   }, [canvasComponents]);
   ```

4. **Resize Handlers Enhanced**
   - Single resize: Updates all selected components' dimensions
   - Group resize: Tracks all resized components for guides
   - Same pattern as drag handlers

5. **Selecto Integration**
   - Clears guides when starting selection: `setActiveCanvasComponents([])`
   - Ensures clean transition to next drag/resize operation

6. **AlignmentGuides Call Updated**
   ```typescript
   <AlignmentGuides
     activeComponents={activeCanvasComponents}    // Array format
     allComponents={canvasComponents}
     canvasWidth={pageCanvasWidth}
     tolerance={2}
   />
   ```

## How It Works

### Single Component Drag/Resize

```
User drags component A
  ↓
handleDrag() called
  ↓
activeCanvasComponents = [Component A]
  ↓
AlignmentGuides renders guides for A vs all others
  ↓
Shows:
  - A's edges aligned with other components
  - A's dimensions matching other components
  - A's center aligned with other components
```

### Multi-Component Drag/Resize

```
User selects components A, B, C with Selecto
User drags the group
  ↓
handleDragGroup() called
  ↓
activeCanvasComponents = [Component A (updated), Component B (updated), Component C (updated)]
  ↓
AlignmentGuides renders guides for A, B, C vs all others
  ↓
Shows:
  - All alignment feedback for all dragged components
  - Helps user align group to other elements
  - Max 10 guides to prevent clutter
```

### Alignment Detection

```
For each active component:
  For each other component:
    Check if edges align (tolerance: 2px)
    Check if dimensions match (tolerance: 2px)
    Check if centers align (tolerance: 2px)

Create guides for all matches
Sort by relevance (dimensions first, then edges, then centers)
Render top 10 guides
```

## Integration with Existing Stack

### Moveable.js Configuration

Already present in DashboardCanvas.tsx (lines 543-587):
```typescript
<Moveable
  snappable={true}              // Grid snapping enabled
  snapGridWidth={20}            // 20px grid
  snapGridHeight={20}
  isDisplaySnapDigit={true}     // Shows dimension digits (Moveable's built-in)
  snapGap={true}                // Shows gap indicators
  snapElement={true}            // Snap to elements
  snapCenter={true}             // Snap to centers
  snapVertical={true}
  snapHorizontal={true}
  // ... additional config
/>
```

### Why This Works Well

1. **Moveable's built-in guides** show grid/gap/snap info
   - Dimension digits: Shows "width: 250px", etc during drag
   - Gap indicators: Shows distance between elements
   - Snap grid: Shows alignment to 20px grid

2. **Our custom AlignmentGuides** show component-to-component alignment
   - Edge alignment to other components
   - Center alignment to other components
   - Dimension matching to other components
   - Professional visualization

3. **Combined Effect**
   - User sees BOTH Moveable's snap info AND our alignment info
   - Professional, Looker/Figma-like experience
   - No conflicts or overlapping

## Testing Guide

### Test Case 1: Single Component Alignment

**Setup:**
1. Open dashboard builder
2. Add 2-3 components to canvas
3. Position them at different locations

**Test:**
1. Drag component A toward component B
2. **Verify:**
   - Purple line appears when edges align (tolerance: 2px)
   - Dimension labels show matching widths/heights
   - Guides disappear after drag ends

**Expected:** Professional alignment feedback like Looker Studio

### Test Case 2: Multi-Select Alignment

**Setup:**
1. Select components A and B with Selecto (drag-to-select box)
2. Position them apart from other components

**Test:**
1. Drag the selected group toward component C
2. **Verify:**
   - Guides show for BOTH A and B to C
   - Max 10 guides (no clutter)
   - All guides disappear after drag ends

**Expected:** Group alignment with visual feedback

### Test Case 3: Resize Alignment

**Setup:**
1. Have components with different widths/heights
2. Select one component

**Test:**
1. Resize the component by dragging corner
2. **Verify:**
   - Dimension guides update in real-time
   - Shows when width matches another component
   - Shows when height matches another component

**Expected:** Real-time dimension feedback during resize

### Test Case 4: Multi-Resize Alignment

**Setup:**
1. Select 2-3 components with Selecto
2. Position them away from other components

**Test:**
1. Resize the group together
2. **Verify:**
   - Guides show during resize
   - All selected components' dimensions considered
   - Guides disappear after resize ends

**Expected:** Multi-component resize with alignment feedback

### Test Case 5: Performance

**Setup:**
1. Create dashboard with 50+ components

**Test:**
1. Drag/resize components
2. Perform multi-select drag
3. Perform multi-select resize
4. **Verify:**
   - No lag or stuttering
   - 60 FPS maintained
   - Guides render smoothly

**Expected:** Responsive interface even with many components

### Test Case 6: Canvas Size

**Setup:**
1. Adjust canvas width/height via CanvasContainer controls

**Test:**
1. Drag component near canvas edge
2. Resize component near canvas edge
3. **Verify:**
   - Guides only appear within canvas bounds
   - No guides extend beyond canvas
   - Alignment still works correctly

**Expected:** Guides respect canvas boundaries
