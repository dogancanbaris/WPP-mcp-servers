## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Weekly SEO Review

**Trigger:** User says "review SEO performance for [client]"

**Steps:**
1. **Use content-gap-analyzer skill:**
   - Query BigQuery for top 50 pages
   - Find low-position keywords (pos 11-30)
   - Cluster by topic/theme
   - Identify content gaps

2. **Generate insights:**
   - Top performing topics
   - Optimization opportunities
   - Missing content themes
   - Traffic gain estimates

3. **Ask user preference:**
   - "Quick report in chat?" → Present markdown report
   - "Create dashboard?" → Use metabase-dashboard-builder

4. **If changes needed:**
   - User approves content recommendations
   - Can update Google Ads targeting based on insights

**Output:** SEO analysis + recommendations + optional dashboard

---

### Workflow 2: Campaign Optimization

**Trigger:** User says "optimize my Google Ads campaigns"

**Steps:**
1. **Use cross-platform-analyzer skill:**
   - Query Ads performance from BigQuery
   - Check for paid/organic overlap
   - Analyze conversion rates vs spend

2. **Identify opportunities:**
   - Wasted spend (bidding on organic rankings)
   - Underperforming campaigns (high cost, low conversions)
   - Scaling opportunities (high ROAS, budget-constrained)

3. **Generate recommendations:**
   - "Pause Ads for 23 keywords ranking organically" → Save $2,400/month
   - "Increase budget 20% for Campaign X" → ROAS is 8.2x
   - "Add 15 negative keywords" → Reduce waste

4. **Execute approved changes via MCP:**
   - Use `add_negative_keywords` tool (with safety)
   - Use `update_budget` tool (with preview + approval)
   - Use `update_campaign_status` tool (if pausing)
   - All changes logged, snapshotted, reversible

**Output:** Optimization analysis + executed changes + impact report

---

### Workflow 3: Client Onboarding

**Trigger:** User says "set up analytics for new client [name]"

**Steps:**
1. **Set up data foundation:**
   - Create BigQuery dataset: `create_bigquery_dataset`
   - Configure data transfers:
     - `create_transfer_search_console`
     - `create_transfer_analytics`
     - `create_transfer_google_ads`

2. **Set up GA4 (if needed):**
   - `create_analytics_property` (new GA4 property)
   - `create_data_stream` (tracking setup)
   - `create_conversion_event` (mark purchase as conversion)
   - `create_google_ads_link` (link to Ads for conversion import)

3. **Create initial dashboards:**
   - Use metabase-dashboard-builder
   - "Weekly SEO Performance" dashboard
   - "Google Ads Campaign Review" dashboard
   - "GA4 Conversion Funnel" dashboard

4. **Verify setup:**
   - Check data flowing to BigQuery
   - Test dashboards load correctly
   - Confirm GA4 tracking working

**Output:** Complete client setup + dashboard URLs + verification report

---

### Workflow 4: Monthly Client Report

**Trigger:** User says "create monthly report for [client]"

**Steps:**
1. **Gather cross-platform data:**
   - Use cross-platform-analyzer
   - Get Ads spend + conversions + ROAS
   - Get organic traffic + rankings
   - Get GA4 conversions + revenue

2. **Generate insights:**
   - Month-over-month changes
   - Channel performance comparison
   - ROI analysis
   - Key wins and challenges

3. **Create presentation dashboard:**
   - Use metabase-dashboard-builder
   - "Client ABC - October 2025 Performance"
   - Executive summary metrics
   - Trend charts
   - Performance tables
   - Export-friendly format

4. **Generate written report:**
   - Executive summary
   - Key metrics (tables)
   - Insights and analysis
   - Recommendations for next month

**Output:** Metabase dashboard URL + written report (markdown/PDF ready)

## Intelligent Routing Logic

### Decision Tree:

**Question Type → Destination:**

| User Request | Route To | Why |
|--------------|----------|-----|
| "Show me top N..." | BigQuery aggregated query | Quick, 50-200 rows, efficient |
| "Analyze trends..." | BigQuery time-series query | 12-52 rows (months/weeks) |
| "Find optimization opportunities..." | BigQuery + analysis | 100-300 rows, actionable insights |
| "Create report for client..." | Metabase dashboard | Persistent, shareable, full data |
| "Export all data..." | Metabase dashboard | Direct BigQuery export |
| "Update budget..." | MCP write tool | Needs approval + safety |
| "Add keywords..." | MCP write tool | Needs preview + confirmation |

### Row Count Thresholds:

- **0-50 rows:** Direct BigQuery, single query
- **50-400 rows:** BigQuery multiple queries, aggregate
- **Need ALL rows:** Create Metabase dashboard (direct BigQuery connection)
- **Make changes:** Use MCP write tools (with safety workflow)

## Safety Integration

ALL write operations go through MCP safety:

1. **Preview generated:** Show current → proposed state
2. **Financial impact:** If budget/bid changes
3. **Approval required:** User must confirm with token
4. **Snapshot taken:** For rollback
5. **Notification sent:** Central admin + agency manager
6. **Audit logged:** Complete trail

**Never bypass safety!** Even when practitioner seems sure, always show preview.

   Monthly waste: $1,850

   Recommendations:
