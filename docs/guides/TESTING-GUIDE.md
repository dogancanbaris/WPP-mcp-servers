## Testing Safety Features

### 1. Test Approval Workflow (Budget Update)

This is the most comprehensive integration example.

**Without Confirmation (Get Preview):**

```bash
# Start the MCP server in one terminal
cd "/home/dogancanbaris/projects/MCP Servers"
npm run dev

# In another terminal or MCP client, call the tool:
```

Call `update_budget` with these params:
```json
{
  "customerId": "2191558405",
  "budgetId": "your_budget_id",
  "newDailyAmountDollars": 100
}
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "requiresApproval": true,
  "preview": "📋 PREVIEW: update_budget\n...",
  "confirmationToken": "abc123...",
  "message": "Budget update requires approval..."
}
```

**With Confirmation (Execute):**

Call `update_budget` again with the confirmation token:
```json
{
  "customerId": "2191558405",
  "budgetId": "your_budget_id",
  "newDailyAmountDollars": 100,
  "confirmationToken": "abc123..."
}
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "previousAmount": "$50.00",
    "newAmount": "$100.00",
    "dailyDifference": "$50.00",
    "monthlyImpact": "$1,520.00",
    "percentageChange": "+100.0%",
    "message": "✅ Budget updated from $50.00/day to $100.00/day"
  }
}
```

### 2. Test Budget Cap (>500% Blocked)

Call `update_budget` with a huge increase:
```json
{
  "customerId": "2191558405",
  "budgetId": "your_budget_id",
  "newDailyAmountDollars": 1000
}
```

**Expected Result (if current budget is $50):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Budget change of 1900% exceeds maximum allowed (500%). This change must be made directly in Google Ads UI for safety."
}
```

### 3. Test Vagueness Detection

Call `update_campaign_status` with vague params:
```json
{
  "customerId": "2191558405",
  "campaignId": "some_campaign",
  "status": "PAUSED"
}
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "⚠️ VAGUE REQUEST DETECTED\n\nVagueness Score: 35/100 (30+ blocks execution)\n\n🔍 Vague terms found: some\n\n❗ Required clarifications:\n   1. Specify exactly which campaign...\n..."
}
```

### 4. Test Pattern Matching (Bulk Limit)

If you try to add >20 keywords at once:

```json
{
  "customerId": "2191558405",
  "adGroupId": "123",
  "keywords": [/* array with 25 keywords */]
}
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Cannot add 25 keywords in one operation. Maximum is 50. Please batch into smaller operations."
}
```

---

## Testing HTTP Server

### 1. Start HTTP Server

```bash
cd "/home/dogancanbaris/projects/MCP Servers"

# Set environment variables
export HTTP_PORT=3000
export OMA_API_KEY=test_key_12345
export OMA_MCP_SHARED_SECRET=test_secret_67890

# Start server
node dist/http-server/index.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[INFO] Starting MCP HTTP server
[INFO] Environment variables validated
[INFO] MCP HTTP server running on port 3000
[INFO] Ready to accept requests from OMA platform
```

### 2. Test Health Endpoint

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T...",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 3. Test List Tools Endpoint

```bash
curl -H "X-OMA-API-Key: test_key_12345" \
  http://localhost:3000/mcp/tools/list
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "list_properties",
      "description": "List all Search Console properties...",
      "inputSchema": {...}
    },
    ...
  ],
  "count": 31
}
```

### 4. Test Authentication Failure

```bash
curl -H "X-OMA-API-Key: wrong_key" \
  http://localhost:3000/mcp/tools/list
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid API key"
}
```

### 5. Test Tool Execution

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-OMA-API-Key: test_key_12345" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "toolName": "list_properties",
    "input": {},
    "userId": "user@example.com"
  }' \
  http://localhost:3000/mcp/execute-tool
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "toolName": "list_properties",
  "result": {
    "success": true,
    "properties": [...]
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T..."
}
```

## Running Automated Tests

### 1. Install Test Dependencies

```bash
cd "/home/dogancanbaris/projects/MCP Servers"

# Install Jest and related packages
npm install --save-dev @jest/globals jest ts-jest @types/jest
```

### 2. Configure Jest

Create `jest.config.js`:
```javascript
module.exports = {

  testEnvironment: 'node',
  roots: ['<rootDir>/tests'],
  testMatch: ['**/*.test.ts'],
  moduleNameMapper: {

## Testing Complete Workflow End-to-End

### Scenario: Update a Budget with Full Safety

**1. Check Current Budgets**

Call `list_budgets`:
```json
{
  "customerId": "2191558405"
}
```

**2. Attempt Vague Request (Should Fail)**

Call `update_budget` with incomplete info:
```json
{
  "customerId": "2191558405",
  "budgetId": "some budget",
  "newDailyAmountDollars": 100
}
```

**Expected:** VagueRequestError

**3. Make Specific Request (Get Preview)**

Call `update_budget` with specific values:
```json
{
  "customerId": "2191558405",
  "budgetId": "12345",
  "newDailyAmountDollars": 100
}
```

**Expected:** Preview with confirmation token

**4. Review Preview**

Check the preview output:
- Changes listed
- Financial impact calculated
- Risks identified
- Recommendations provided

**5. Confirm Operation**

Call `update_budget` with confirmation token:
```json
{
  "customerId": "2191558405",
  "budgetId": "12345",
  "newDailyAmountDollars": 100,
  "confirmationToken": "token_from_step_3"
}
```

**Expected:** Operation executes successfully

**6. Verify Snapshot Created**

Check that a snapshot was created (in production, this would be in DynamoDB)

## Testing Remaining Integrations

For the 4 tools that need integration:

### add_keywords

**Test Plan:**
1. Try to add >50 keywords → Should be blocked
2. Add 5 keywords without confirmation → Should show preview
3. Confirm and add keywords → Should execute

### add_negative_keywords

**Test Plan:**
1. Try pattern matching with >20 matches → Should show TooManyMatchesError
2. Add specific negatives → Should show preview and execute on confirmation

### submit_sitemap

**Test Plan:**
1. Submit without confirmation → Should show preview
2. Confirm and submit → Should execute

### delete_sitemap

**Test Plan:**
1. Delete without confirmation → Should show preview with risks
2. Confirm deletion → Should execute

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot find module"

**Solution:** Run `npm run build` to compile TypeScript

### Issue: "Invalid confirmation token"

**Solution:** Token expired (60 seconds). Generate a new preview.

### Issue: "Vague request detected"

**Solution:** Provide specific IDs and values instead of vague terms.

### Issue: "Budget change exceeds maximum allowed"

**Solution:** Change is >500%. Use Google Ads UI for large changes.

### Issue: HTTP server won't start

**Solution:** Check that environment variables are set:
```bash
echo $OMA_API_KEY
echo $OMA_MCP_SHARED_SECRET
```
