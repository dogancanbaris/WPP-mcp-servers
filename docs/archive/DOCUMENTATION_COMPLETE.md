## Key Features Documented

### Decision Framework
Clear guidance on WHEN to use controls:

**Use Controls When:**
- Dashboard will be interactive
- Users need dynamic filtering
- Date range should be adjustable
- Multiple charts respond to same filter
- Building exploratory dashboards

**DON'T Use Controls When:**
- Dashboard is static/report-style
- Specific date range is required
- Each chart needs independent filtering
- Dashboard is for automated reporting

### Comparison Mode
Comprehensive explanation of comparison capabilities:

**When enabled (showComparison: true):**
- Scorecards show % change badges
- Line charts show dashed comparison line
- Bar charts show grouped current vs previous
- Tables include change % columns
- Perfect for trend analysis

### Component-Level Overrides
Documentation on selective control application:

```json
{
  "type": "scorecard",
  "title": "Year-to-Date",
  "metrics": ["revenue"],
  "usePageFilters": false  // Ignores page filters
}
```

**Use for:**
- Context metrics
- Reference figures
- Benchmark comparisons

### Best Practices
Actionable guidance including:
- Placement strategies
- Control combination patterns
- Default value recommendations
- Performance optimization
- Searchable dropdown guidelines
- Component override principles
