## Key Documentation Improvements

### Control Types Documented

1. **date_range_filter**
   - Optional comparison mode (WoW, MoM, YoY)
   - 7 default range options
   - Automatic chart updates

2. **checkbox_filter**
   - Boolean/flag dimension filtering
   - Perfect for "Active Only" type filters

3. **list_filter**
   - Multi-select from dimension values
   - Optional search functionality
   - Best for countries, devices, campaigns

4. **dimension_control**
   - Dynamic dimension switching
   - Switches grouping across all charts
   - Exploratory dashboard pattern

5. **slider_filter**
   - Numeric range filtering
   - Min/max with optional step
   - Cost and impression filtering

### Decision Framework

Clear guidance on when to use controls:

**Use Controls When:**
- Dashboard will be used interactively
- Users need dynamic filtering
- Date range needs adjustment
- Multiple charts respond to same filter
- Building exploratory dashboards

**Don't Use Controls When:**
- Dashboard is static/report-style
- Specific date range is required
- Each chart needs independent filtering
- Dashboard is for automated reporting

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: SEO Performance Dashboard
- Title + date range filter header
- 3 scorecard KPIs
- Time-series trend chart
- Simple, focused control usage

#### Example 2: Campaign Performance Dashboard
- Title + date range filter (with comparison) header
- Two list filters (campaigns, status)
- Four KPI scorecards
- Time-series and table
- Multi-filter pattern

#### Example 3: Quarterly Analysis
- Date range filter for current period
- Three scorecards showing current/YTD/prior year
- Uses `usePageFilters: false` for context metrics
- Component override pattern

### Best Practices Included

1. Place controls in first row after title
2. Use date_range_filter on most time-series dashboards
3. Combine 2-3 controls maximum
4. Test comparison mode to ensure charts display
5. Use component overrides sparingly
6. Limit to 10-15 components per dashboard
7. Group related metrics in rows
8. Provide sensible default ranges

### Comparison Mode Documentation

**When showComparison: true:**
- Scorecards show % change badges (↑ 15.3% vs prior)
- Line charts show dashed comparison line
- Bar charts show grouped current vs previous
- Tables include change % columns

## Code Snippet: Updated Tool Definition

```typescript
export const createDashboardTool = {
  name: 'create_dashboard',
  description: `Create a new dashboard in the WPP Analytics Platform with specified layout.

**Purpose:**
Programmatically create dashboards with custom layouts, components, and data sources.
Dashboards are saved to Supabase and immediately accessible in the web UI.
Support interactive filtering via page-level controls that affect all components.

**IMPORTANT: Page-Level Controls**

Controls are special components that emit filters affecting ALL components on the same page.
Use controls to give users interactive filtering without editing queries.

[... 400+ lines of detailed documentation ...]

**Best Practices:**
1. Place controls in first row (after title) for visibility
2. Use date_range_filter on most dashboards with time-series data
3. Combine 2-3 controls maximum to avoid filter fatigue
4. Test comparison mode to ensure charts display correctly
5. Use component overrides (usePageFilters: false) sparingly
6. Limit to 10-15 components per dashboard for performance
7. Group related metrics together in rows
8. Provide sensible default ranges/values for controls
