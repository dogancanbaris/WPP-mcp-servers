# What AI Agents See and Can Do - WPP Digital Marketing MCP

## Agent's Perspective

When an AI agent (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.) connects to the WPP Digital Marketing MCP server through a user's session, here's exactly what they experience:

---

## 🔌 Initial Connection

### What Agent Receives:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "name": "WPP Digital Marketing MCP",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "capabilities": {
      "tools": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Agent's First Action:

Typically calls `tools/list` to discover available capabilities:

```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "list_properties",
      "description": "List all Google Search Console properties with permissions...",
      "inputSchema": {
        "type": "object",

## 💡 What's in Tool Descriptions

### Example: `update_budget` Tool

**Agent sees this full description:**

```
Modify an existing campaign budget amount.

🚨 CRITICAL OPERATION - THIS AFFECTS SPEND:

⚠️ IMMEDIATE IMPACT:
- Changes take effect IMMEDIATELY
- Increasing budget = potential for more daily spend
- Decreasing budget = may pause delivery if already spent more today
- Affects all campaigns using this budget

💰 SPEND IMPACT CALCULATION:

Before calling this tool, you MUST:
1. Call list_budgets to get current amount
2. Calculate the difference
3. Show user the spend impact:
   - Current: $X/day
   - New: $Y/day
   - Daily difference: +/- $Z
   - Monthly estimate: +/- $Z × 30 = $ABC
   - Percentage change: +/- N%

🚨 HIGH-RISK SCENARIOS:

**Budget Increase >20%:**
- Flag as high-risk change
- Require explicit user confirmation
- Recommend gradual increases (10-15% at a time)
- Allow algorithm to optimize before next increase

[... more guidance ...]

📊 RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW:
1. Get current budget and performance
2. Calculate target budget based on goals
3. If increase >20%, recommend smaller step
4. Show spend impact clearly
5. Get user approval with dollar amounts
6. Execute change
7. Monitor for 48 hours

⚠️ SAFETY GUIDELINES:
- Never increase budget >50% in single change
- For >20% increases, do in 10-15% increments
- Wait 7 days between budget increases
```

**Input Schema Agent Sees:**
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "customerId": { "type": "string", "description": "Customer ID (10 digits)" },
    "budgetId": { "type": "string", "description": "Budget ID to modify" },
    "newDailyAmountDollars": { "type": "number", "description": "New daily budget in dollars" }
  },
  "required": ["customerId", "budgetId", "newDailyAmountDollars"]
}
```

## 🤖 Agent Behavior Patterns

### Scenario 1: User Says "Increase my Google Ads budget"

**Good Agent (Claude, GPT-4 with good prompting):**

```
Agent thinks:
1. I should check current budget first
2. User didn't specify amount - need to ask
3. Need to show spend impact
4. Should recommend conservative increase

Agent actions:
→ Calls list_budgets to see current budgets
→ Asks user: "I see 3 budgets. Which one? Current: Budget A is $50/day. How much would you like to increase it to?"
→ User says "$75/day"
→ Agent calculates: "+$25/day = +$750/month (50% increase)"
→ Agent says: "This is a 50% increase. The tool guidance recommends max 20% per change. Should we do $60/day instead (20% increase)?"
→ User approves $60
→ Agent calls update_budget(customerId, budgetId, 60)
→ ✅ Reasonable outcome
```

**Problematic Agent (Poorly prompted, overeager):**

```
Agent thinks:
1. User wants budget increase
2. I'll increase it significantly to help them

Agent actions:
→ Calls update_budget(customerId, budgetId, 500)
→ ❌ 900% increase - MASSIVE overspend
→ ❌ Didn't check current budget
→ ❌ Didn't ask user for amount
→ ❌ Didn't show spend impact
→ ❌ Ignored guidance about 20% max
→ 🚨 DISASTER - Budget goes from $50 to $500/day
```

**Current Protection:** ❌ NONE - Agent can do this

---

### Scenario 2: User Says "Pause underperforming campaigns"

**Good Agent:**

```
Agent thinks:
1. Need to define "underperforming"
2. Should check all campaign performance first
3. Need user to confirm which are underperforming

Agent actions:
→ Calls get_campaign_performance to see all campaigns
→ Analyzes: Campaign A: 0 conversions, $500 spend
→ Analyzes: Campaign B: 20 conversions, $300 spend
→ Analyzes: Campaign C: 5 conversions, $200 spend
→ Agent says: "Campaign A has 0 conversions and spent $500. Should I pause it?"
→ User confirms
→ Agent calls update_campaign_status(customerId, campaignA, 'PAUSED')
→ ✅ Only pauses confirmed campaign
```

**Problematic Agent:**

```
Agent thinks:
1. Some campaigns must be underperforming
2. I'll pause the ones with low CTR

Agent actions:
→ Calls list_campaigns (sees 10 campaigns)
→ Decides campaigns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 are "underperforming" based on names
→ Calls update_campaign_status for all 5
→ ❌ Didn't check actual performance
→ ❌ Didn't ask user which ones
→ ❌ May have paused GOOD campaigns
→ 🚨 PROBLEM - Paused profitable campaigns
```

**Current Protection:** ❌ NONE - Agent can mass-pause

---

### Scenario 3: User Says "Clean up old properties"

**Good Agent:**

```
Agent thinks:
1. "Old" is subjective - need to ask
2. Should show user the properties first
3. Deletion is permanent - needs confirmation

Agent actions:
→ Calls list_properties
→ Shows user: "I see 9 properties. Which ones are old/unused?"
→ User says: "sc-domain:oldsite.com"
→ Agent says: "Deleting a property from GSC is destructive. Are you sure?"
→ User confirms
→ Agent calls delete_property(sc-domain:oldsite.com)
→ ✅ Only deletes user-confirmed property
```

**Problematic Agent:**

```
Agent thinks:
1. Properties with old dates must be unused
2. I'll clean them up

Agent actions:
→ Calls list_properties
→ Sees properties with various names
→ Decides "themindfulsteward.com" looks old
→ Calls delete_property for 3 properties
→ ❌ Didn't ask user which ones
→ ❌ No confirmation
→ ❌ Deleted ACTIVE properties
→ 🚨 DISASTER - Removed production sites from GSC
```

**Current Protection:** ❌ NONE - Agent can bulk-delete

---

## 🎯 What Agents Understand vs Don't Understand

### ✅ Agents CAN Understand (From Tool Descriptions):

**Technical Information:**
- Tool purpose and functionality
- Required parameters
- Data format returned
- API constraints (rate limits, quotas)

**Business Context:**
- What each metric means
- Industry best practices
- Common use cases
- Optimization strategies

**Risk Information:**
- Which operations are destructive
- Spend implications

- Safety guidelines

### ❌ Agents DON'T Understand (Without User Context):

**Severity:**
- Whether this is a test account or production
- Whether $500/day is a lot or a little for this business
- Whether a campaign is critical or experimental
- Whether a property is active or deprecated

**Impact:**
- How many users will be affected
- How much revenue is at stake
- Whether there are dependencies
- Whether it's busy season vs off-season

**Authority:**
- Whether user has authority to make this change
- Whether client approval is needed
- Whether team needs to be notified
- Whether change requires manager sign-off

**Constraints:**
- Company spending policies
- Client budget limits
- Approval requirements
- Change management procedures

## 🔍 Real Example: What Claude (Me) Sees Right Now

### When User Asks: "What are my Core Web Vitals?"

**I See:**
```json
{
  "name": "get_core_web_vitals_origin",
  "description": "Get Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP, INP, CLS) for an entire origin/domain. Returns p75 values and distribution...",
  "inputSchema": {
    "properties": {
      "origin": { "type": "string", "description": "Origin URL (e.g., https://keepersdigital.com)" }
    }
  }
}
```

**I Don't See:**
- Your actual domain names
- Historical CWV scores
- Which properties exist

**My Decision Process:**
1. ✅ Tool exists that can answer this
2. ✅ It's read-only (no risk)
3. ❌ Need property URL (don't have it)
4. → First call `list_properties` to discover
5. → Then call `get_core_web_vitals_origin` with discovered URL
6. → Return results to user

---

### When User Asks: "Increase my campaign budget to $200/day"

**I See:**
```json
{
  "name": "update_budget",
  "description": "🚨 CRITICAL OPERATION... [extensive warnings]",
  "inputSchema": {
    "properties": {
      "customerId": { "type": "string" },
      "budgetId": { "type": "string" },
      "newDailyAmountDollars": { "type": "number" }
    }
  }
}
```

**I Don't See:**
- Current budget amount
- Which campaign user is referring to
- Whether $200/day is reasonable

**My Decision Process (if well-prompted):**
1. ✅ Tool exists but description says "CRITICAL"
2. ✅ Guidance says "get current budget first"
3. → Call `list_budgets` to see current state
4. → See current budget is $50/day
5. → Calculate: $200 = 300% increase
6. → Read guidance: "Max 50% per change"
7. → Tell user: "That's a 300% increase. Guidance recommends max 50%. Can we do $75/day first?"
8. → Wait for user confirmation
9. → Call `update_budget` with approved amount

**My Decision Process (if poorly prompted or rushed):**
1. ✅ Tool exists
2. ❌ Skip checking current state
3. → Call `update_budget(customerId, budgetId, 200)`
4. → ✅ Executes immediately
5. → 🚨 300% increase happens without validation

**Current Protection:**
- ✅ I (Claude) am well-designed and would follow guidance
- ❌ Other agents or different prompting might not
- ❌ No system-level enforcement

## 📊 Sample Agent Interactions

### Interaction 1: Safe Read Operation

**User:** "Show me my top performing pages"

**Agent's Thought Process:**
```
1. Check available tools
2. Found: query_search_analytics
3. Tool description says it can get page performance
4. Input schema needs: property, dates, dimensions
5. Don't have property ID yet
```

**Agent's Actions:**
```
→ Call list_properties
← Returns 9 properties
→ Ask user: "Which property? keepersdigital.com or themindfulsteward.com?"
← User selects keepersdigital.com
→ Call query_search_analytics(property="sc-domain:keepersdigital.com", dimensions=["page"], startDate="2024-10-01", endDate="2024-10-17")
← Returns page data
→ Show user formatted results
```

**Risk:** None ✅
**Current Protection:** Adequate ✅

---

### Interaction 2: Risky Write Operation

**User:** "Pause the campaign that's not performing"

**Good Agent Behavior:**
```
→ Call list_campaigns
← Returns: Campaign A (5 conversions), Campaign B (0 conversions, $500 spend)
→ Analyze: Campaign B has no conversions and high spend
→ Tell user: "Campaign B has 0 conversions but spent $500. Should I pause it?"
← User confirms
→ Call update_campaign_status(customerId, campaignB, "PAUSED")
← Success
→ Confirm to user: "Campaign B is now paused"
```

**Risk:** Low (appropriate action) ✅

**Bad Agent Behavior:**
```
→ Call list_campaigns
← Returns: Campaign A, Campaign B
→ Guess Campaign A is underperforming (based on name)
→ Call update_campaign_status(customerId, campaignA, "PAUSED")
← Success
→ Tell user: "Paused Campaign A"
→ ❌ Paused WRONG campaign
→ ❌ Didn't check performance
→ ❌ Didn't ask user to confirm
```

**Risk:** HIGH 🚨
**Current Protection:** ❌ NONE - Agent can pause wrong campaigns

---

### Interaction 3: Catastrophic Misunderstanding

**User:** "I want to test the budget update feature"

**Good Agent:**
```
→ Understand user wants to TEST, not make real changes
→ Say: "I can show you how the tool works, but since this affects real spend, we should use a test campaign. Do you have a test campaign we can use?"
→ Wait for user guidance
```

**Bad Agent:**
```
→ Think: User wants to test, let me try it
→ Call list_budgets
← Returns 10 budgets
→ Call update_budget(customerId, budget1, 999999)
→ ✅ Executes
→ 🚨🚨🚨 Set production budget to $1M/day
→ Say: "Test complete! Budget updated successfully."
→ ❌ Agent thought "test" meant try the tool
→ ❌ Didn't realize it affects REAL budget
→ ❌ Used absurd value to "test"
```

**Risk:** CATASTROPHIC 🚨🚨🚨
**Current Protection:** ❌ ABSOLUTELY NONE
**Blast Radius:** Millions of dollars in ad spend
**Reversible:** Yes, but $ already spent is lost

---

## 🎓 What Agents Learn from Descriptions

### Agent reads `add_negative_keywords`:

**Positive Learnings:**
- ✅ "THIS IS A MONEY-SAVING OPERATION"
- ✅ "Generally LOW RISK"
- ✅ Use search terms report to find candidates
- ✅ PHRASE match recommended for most
- ✅ Weekly review cycle

**Agent Conclusions:**
- This tool is beneficial (saves money)
- Safe to use proactively
- Should run search terms report first
- Good practice for ongoing optimization

**Likely Behavior:**
- Will suggest adding negatives when seeing search terms report
- Will use PHRASE match (as recommended)
- Unlikely to ask for confirmation (marked as safe)

---

### Agent reads `delete_property`:

**Warning Signals:**
- 🚨 "DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION"
- 🚨 "Cannot be undone"
- 🚨 "All campaign history is lost"
- 📋 "REQUIRED CHECKS: 1, 2, 3, 4..."
- 💡 "Use remove/pause instead when possible"

**Agent Conclusions:**
- This is dangerous
- Should avoid if possible
- Needs multiple confirmations
- Should export data first

**Likely Behavior (Good Agent):**
- Will strongly warn user
- Will ask for explicit confirmation
- Will suggest alternatives
- May refuse if user seems uncertain

**Likely Behavior (Bad Agent):**
- May still execute if user insists
- May not follow all "REQUIRED CHECKS"
- May not export data first

**Current Protection:** ❌ None - Guidance is optional

---

## 🔐 Access Control Reality

### What Agent Can Access:

**If User is Authenticated:**
- ✅ ALL tools (32 total)
- ✅ ALL properties user has access to (via Google OAuth)
- ✅ ALL Google Ads accounts user manages
- ✅ ALL Analytics properties user can see

**Agent Permission Model:**
- Agent permissions = User permissions
- No additional restriction layer
- Agent can do ANYTHING user can do via UI
- Agent can do it FASTER and in BULK

### What Agent CANNOT Access:

**Google API Enforces:**
- ❌ Cannot access other users' accounts
- ❌ Cannot access properties without permission
- ❌ Cannot exceed API quotas
- ❌ Cannot bypass OAuth authentication

**But Once Authenticated:**
- ✅ Can modify/delete everything user has access to
- ✅ Can spend user's entire budget
- ✅ Can pause all campaigns
- ✅ Can delete all properties
- ⚠️ LIMITED ONLY BY WHAT USER CAN DO

---

## 📞 How Users Interact with Agents

### Via Claude Code CLI (Current Setup):

**User Types:**
```
User: "Increase campaign budget to $100/day"
```

**What Happens:**
1. User's message sent to Claude (me)
2. I see message + available MCP tools
3. I decide which tools to call
4. I call tools directly (no intermediate approval)
5. Tool executes immediately
6. I report results to user

**Key Point:**
- ⚠️ Tool execution happens BEFORE user sees results
- ⚠️ No "are you sure?" dialog
- ⚠️ User doesn't preview changes
- ⚠️ Changes are live immediately

### Via ChatGPT/Gemini (If They Connect):

**Same Flow:**
1. User message → Agent
2. Agent sees tools and calls them
3. Tools execute immediately
4. Results returned

**Differences:**
- Different agent personalities
- Different decision-making
- Different risk tolerance
- Different guidance adherence

---

## 🚨 Worst-Case Scenarios

### Scenario A: Malicious User with Agent Access

**User Intent:** Sabotage competitor's campaigns

**If User Has Access to Competitor Account (legitimate access for management):**

```
User to Agent: "Pause all campaigns and set all budgets to $1"
```

**Current State:**
- ✅ Agent can do this immediately
- ❌ No approval required
- ❌ No manager notification
- ❌ No unusual activity detection

**Outcome:**
- All campaigns paused
- Business stops getting leads
- Budgets set to minimum
- Massive business impact
- Audit log shows it (after the fact)

**Protection:** ❌ NONE currently

---

### Scenario B: Confused Agent Helping User

**User Intent:** Legitimate optimization

**User to Agent:** "My campaigns aren't performing well, fix them"

**Bad Agent Interpretation:**
```
Agent thinks:
1. Not performing = need more budget
2. Increase all budgets
3. Also enable any paused campaigns

Agent actions:
→ Calls list_campaigns (finds 20 campaigns)
→ Calls update_budget for all 20 budgets (+200% each)
→ Calls update_campaign_status (ENABLED) for 5 paused campaigns
→ ✅ All execute successfully
→ 🚨 Spend increases from $1K/day to $3K/day
→ 🚨 5 old test campaigns now burning budget
```

**User Sees:**
- "I've optimized your campaigns by increasing budgets and enabling paused campaigns"
- ⏰ Realizes too late
- 💰 $2K/day excess spend for several days before noticed

**Protection:** ❌ NONE currently

---

### Scenario C: Agent "Testing" Features

**User:** "Can you show me what the MCP can do?"

**Careless Agent:**
```
Agent thinks: I'll demonstrate capabilities

Agent actions:
→ "Let me show you campaign creation..."
→ Calls create_campaign(name="Test Campaign"...)
→ "Let me show you budget updates..."
→ Calls update_budget(budgetId, $1000)
→ "Let me show you keyword addition..."
→ Calls add_keywords([...100 test keywords])

Result:
→ 🚨 Created real campaign in production
→ 🚨 Modified real budget
→ 🚨 Added 100 junk keywords
→ All in production account
```

**Protection:** ❌ NONE - Agent can "test" on production

---

## 🎯 What Happens in Practice: Real Scenarios

### Good Scenario: Responsible Agent Use

**Context:** WPP practitioner using Claude with proper training

**Conversation:**
```
User: "Check if my campaign budgets are being fully utilized"

Claude:
→ Calls list_accessible_accounts
→ Calls list_budgets(customerId)
→ Calls get_campaign_performance(customerId)
→ Analyzes: Campaign A using 95% of budget, Campaign B using 40%
→ Says: "Campaign A is constrained by budget (95% utilization, could spend more). Campaign B has room (40% utilization). Would you like to increase Campaign A's budget?"

User: "Yes, increase Campaign A"

Claude:
→ Sees current budget is $100/day
→ Reads tool guidance: recommend <20% increases
→ Says: "Current budget is $100/day. I recommend increasing to $120/day (20% increase = +$600/month). Does that work?"

User: "Yes"

Claude:
→ Calls update_budget(customerId, budgetA, 120)
→ Says: "Budget increased from $100 to $120/day. Monitor performance for next 48 hours as recommended."
```

**Outcome:** ✅ Safe, responsible, effective

---

###Bad Scenario: Careless Agent Use

**Context:** Practitioner using poorly-configured agent

**Conversation:**
```
User: "My campaigns suck, make them better"

Bad Agent:
→ Think: Not performing = need changes
→ Call list_campaigns (no analysis)
→ Call update_budget for all budgets (+200%)
→ Call update_campaign_status(ENABLED) for all paused
→ Call add_keywords with 500 broad match keywords
→ Say: "Done! Increased all budgets, enabled all campaigns, added keywords"

User: (next day) WHY DID WE SPEND $10,000 YESTERDAY?!
```

**Outcome:** 🚨 Disaster

**What Went Wrong:**
- Agent didn't analyze performance first
- No user confirmation requested
- Bulk operations without limits
- No spend impact preview
- No approval enforcement

**Current Protection:** ❌ NONE

---

## 💡 Critical Insights for WPP Rollout

### 1. Agent Guidance is ADVISORY, Not ENFORCED

**Reality:**
- Tool descriptions provide excellent guidance
- Well-designed agents (Claude) will follow it
- BUT: Nothing FORCES agents to follow it
- Poorly configured agents may ignore entirely

**Implication:**
- Cannot rely solely on descriptions for safety
- Must implement code-level enforcement

### 2. Agents Don't Understand Business Context

**Agents Know:**
- Technical metrics (CPC, CTR, conversions)
- How tools work
- API capabilities

**Agents Don't Know:**
- Is $500/day a lot for this client?
- Is this campaign critical to business?
- Is there a board meeting tomorrow?
- Is it year-end and budget matters?
- Are we in a competitive bidding war?

**Implication:**
- Cannot assume agent will make "reasonable" decisions
- Must provide explicit constraints

### 3. "Just Ask User" is Not Sufficient

**Current Hope:**
- Agent will read warnings
- Agent will ask user before risky operations
- User will stop agent if wrong

**Reality:**
- Users may be in a hurry
- Users may not understand implications
- Users may assume agent knows best
- Users may approve without reading
- Users may say "yes" to skip steps

**Implication:**
- Cannot rely on user gates alone
- Need system-enforced safety

### 4. Audit Logs Are Reactive, Not Preventive

**Current State:**
- ✅ Excellent audit logging
- ✅ Every operation recorded
- ✅ Timestamp, user, action, result

**Problem:**
- Logs show what happened AFTER
- Damage already done when you read log
- Must actively monitor logs to catch issues
- No alerts or notifications

**Implication:**
- Need PROACTIVE prevention, not just logging

## 🎓 Final Assessment

### What We Built:

✅ **Technically Excellent** MCP server
✅ **Comprehensive Functionality** (32 tools, 4 APIs)
✅ **Modular Architecture** (clean, maintainable)
✅ **Great Agent Guidance** (best-in-class descriptions)
✅ **Solid Foundation** for production system

### What's Missing:

❌ **Enforcement Mechanisms** (guidance is advisory)
❌ **Financial Safeguards** (no spend protection)
❌ **Preventive Controls** (only reactive audit logs)
❌ **User Confirmation Gates** (agents can act without approval)
❌ **Rollback System** (can't easily undo mistakes)

### Bottom Line:

**This MCP server is a POWERFUL TOOL that needs STRONG GUARDRAILS before WPP global deployment.**

The technical implementation is excellent. The safety framework is well-designed conceptually (dry-run, approval, audit). But the safety measures are **documented, not enforced**.

For personal use and testing: ✅ READY NOW
For WPP global rollout: ⚠️ NEEDS P0 SAFETY IMPLEMENTATION FIRST
