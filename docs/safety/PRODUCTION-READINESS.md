**Status:** Development complete, testing ready

**Safe For:**
- ✅ Personal accounts (your 9 GSC properties, your Ads account)
- ✅ Development/learning
- ✅ Read-only analytics
- ✅ Single-user supervised testing

**Deploy To:**
- You (the developer)
- Maybe 1-2 technical team members for validation

**Tools Available:**
- All 32 tools
- Manual supervision required for write operations
- Check results immediately after each agent action

**Safety Measures:**
- Human reviews each write operation BEFORE agent calls tool
- Start with test/low-value accounts
- Daily audit log review
- Immediate rollback plan (manual)

**Expected Duration:** 1-2 weeks of personal testing

---

### Phase 1: Internal Pilot - "Approval Enforcement Release"

**Prerequisites (P0 - Must Implement First):**

✅ **1. Mandatory Approval Workflow** (1 week)
```typescript
// Before ANY write operation:
1. Agent calls tool
2. System intercepts and generates dry-run preview
3. User sees:
   - Current state
   - Proposed changes
   - Impact assessment (spend, traffic, etc.)
   - Risk level
4. User clicks "Approve" or "Reject"
5. Only if approved, operation executes
6. Audit log records approval decision
```

**Implementation:**
- Modify MCP server to intercept write tool calls
- Generate preview before execution
- Return preview to agent
- Agent presents to user
- User approval required via CLI prompt
- Store approval/rejection in audit log

✅ **2. Spend Caps for Google Ads** (3 days)
```typescript
const SAFETY_LIMITS = {
  MAX_BUDGET_PER_CAMPAIGN: 1000, // $1000/day max
  MAX_BUDGET_INCREASE_PERCENT: 50, // 50% max increase
  MAX_BUDGET_INCREASE_DOLLARS: 500, // $500 max increase
  MAX_ACCOUNT_TOTAL_BUDGET: 10000, // $10K/day account max
  MAX_BUDGET_CHANGES_PER_DAY: 5, // 5 changes max per day
};

// Enforce before update_budget executes
```

**Implementation:**
- Add limits configuration file
- Validate against limits before execution
- Throw errors if limits exceeded
- Log limit violations

✅ **3. Multi-Step Confirmation for Destructive Ops** (2 days)
```typescript
// For delete_property, delete_sitemap:
1. Agent calls delete tool
2. System prompts: "Type 'DELETE {resource_name}' to confirm"
3. User must type exact match
4. Only then executes
5. Cannot be bypassed
```

**Implementation:**
- Add confirmation prompt to destructive tools
- Require exact text match
- Timeout after 30 seconds
- Log confirmation attempts

✅ **4. Dry-Run Preview System** (3 days)
```typescript
// Use existing DryRunResultBuilder (src/gsc/approval.ts)
// Actually call it from all write tools
const preview = buildDryRunPreview(currentState, proposedChange);
return preview to agent;
// Wait for approval before proceeding
```

**Implementation:**
- Connect existing dry-run code to write tools
- Format previews consistently
- Show before/after clearly
- Include impact calculations

✅ **5. Basic Rollback** (5 days)
```typescript
// Before change:
const snapshot = captureCurrentState();
saveSnapshot(operationId, snapshot);

// If needed:
const lastOperation = getLastOperation();
rollback(lastOperation.snapshot);
```

**Implementation:**
- Snapshot system for campaigns, budgets, keywords
- Store last 10 operations per account
- Rollback API endpoints
- Audit rollback operations

**Total Time:** ~2-3 weeks
**Required Engineers:** 1-2 developers
**Testing Time:** 1 week with 5-10 internal users

**Deploy To:**

- WPP's own marketing accounts (not client)
- Supervised usage initially
- Daily check-ins

**Safety Measures:**

  MAX_KEYWORDS_PER_CALL: 50,
  MAX_CAMPAIGNS_PER_CREATION: 5,
  MAX_PROPERTIES_PER_DELETION: 1,
};
```

✅ **8. User Role System** (1 week)
```typescript
