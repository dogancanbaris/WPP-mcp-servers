## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION

### **Build Custom Platform (Next.js + Tremor + BigQuery)**

**Why:**
1. **You're already building a platform** (59 MCP tools)
2. **Long-term investment** pays off (ROI in 1-2 years)
3. **No vendor dependency** (can't rug-pull you)
4. **Exactly what you need** (no compromises)
5. **Modern tech stack** (Next.js 15, React 19, 2025 best practices)

**Timeline**: 8 weeks (2 months)
**Budget**: $60K + $552/year

**Break-even**: Year 2 (vs Luzmo)

**Alternative if timeline is CRITICAL:**
- Month 1: Use Luzmo ($2K)
- Month 2-3: Build custom platform
- Month 4: Migrate from Luzmo to custom
- Result: Only $4K spent on Luzmo

## ⚠️ RISKS & MITIGATION

### **Risk 1: Development Time**
**Concern**: 8 weeks is a long time
**Mitigation**:
- Start with MVP (4 weeks)
- Iterative delivery (usable at Week 4)
- Consider Luzmo bridge (use while building)

### **Risk 2: Maintenance Burden**
**Concern**: Need to maintain custom code
**Mitigation**:
- Use stable, mature libraries (Next.js, Tremor)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Automated testing
- CI/CD for deployments

### **Risk 3: Scope Creep**
**Concern**: Features keep getting added
**Mitigation**:
